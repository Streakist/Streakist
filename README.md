Hey, i'm Streakist, First name Tom.
I'm a student programmer just finishing my 3rd year of university (most likely finished by the time you're reading this)
Aspiring to be a game developer, and maybe consider some other forms of programming in the future.
I'm currently using Unity for my student projects and have light practice using Unity and Unreal Engine, using C# and C++ as I go.
